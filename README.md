# ANN_churn

This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation for predicting customer churn. It includes two models:

Classification Model 🏷️: Predicts whether a customer will churn (1) or not (0).
Regression Model 💰: Estimates the expected salary of a customer based on their profile.
Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers. This project leverages deep learning to analyze customer data and provide insights into churn behavior and salary estimation.

Features
✅ Binary Classification Model - Uses an ANN to classify customer churn status.
✅ Regression Model - Predicts estimated salary using deep learning.
✅ Streamlit App - Interactive UI to input customer details and get predictions.
✅ Preprocessing Pipelines - Label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.
✅ Model Deployment - Trained models are loaded for real-time inference.

Tech Stack
🔹 Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
🔹 Deep Learning (ANN with multiple layers)
🔹 Streamlit (For the interactive UI)
