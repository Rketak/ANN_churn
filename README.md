# ANN_churn

📌 Overview
This project is a Customer Churn Prediction System using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) based on various customer attributes like credit score, balance, age, and account activity.

The project is built using TensorFlow/Keras for training the model and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.

🚀 Features

✅ Customer Input Form – Users can input details like age, credit score, and balance

✅ One-Hot Encoding & Scaling – Preprocesses categorical and numerical data

✅ Neural Network Model – Uses a trained ANN to predict churn probability

✅ Interactive Web App – Built with Streamlit for easy access and visualization



🛠️ Tech Stack
